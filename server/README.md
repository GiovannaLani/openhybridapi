# LabsLand Hybrid API Server

If you want to test a new simulation, create file in `simulations` that contains something like:

```yaml
name: Watertank
description: This is a watertank simulation
gpios:
  sim2dut:  
    # 3 sensors (low, mid, high)  
    number: 3  
  dut2sim:  
    # 2 actuators (pump1, pump2)  
    number: 4
```

You may specify also "file", "messages -> web2sim -> file", etc.



## Communications

The basic concepts are that there are 2 types of communication: GPIO and messages.

### GPIOS

GPIOs: binary messages (0 or 1), through different input or output channels, named sim2dut and dut2sim:
  1. sim2dut: Simulation to the Device Under Test: there is a number of GPIOs (e.g., 0..2 if number=3) that go from the simulation to the Device Under Test (FPGA, microprocessor... whatever)
  1. dut2sim: Device Under Test to the simulation: there is a number of GPIOs (e.g., 0..3 if number=4) that go from the Device Under Test (FPGA, microprocessor... whatever) to the simulation.

Note 1: these numbers have nothing to do with the real GPIOs in the DUT. For example, maybe in an FPGA, the simulation gpio sim2dut #0 is the GPIO15. This way we abstract from the real board.
Note 2: these numbers are repeated between sim2dut and dut2sim, so make sure not to confuse dut2sim #0 with sim2dut #0.

In the real setup, GPIOs are physically connected from the system running the simulation to the DUT, so it is not subject to network latency issues.

### Messages

Messages are strings (simple, text messages with no newline) send and received from the web to the simulation and from the simulation to the web. Expect these messages to be subject to network latency.

  1. web2sim: from the web interface to the simulation.
  1. sim2web: from the simulation to the web interface.



## Running the simulation

After compiling the simulation (see main README), it may be run:

```
./hybridapi watertank
```

To run the dev server you may in parallel run:

```
$ . devrc
$ export SIMULATION_CONFIG_FILE=watertank-test.yml
$ flask run
```
